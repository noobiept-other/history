Valve's debut title won more than 50 Game of the Year awards, was named "Best Game Ever" by PC Gamer, and launched a franchise which has since sold over 11 million units worldwide. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original Half-Life and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player’s presence affects everything around him or her, from the physical environment to the behaviors and even the emotions of both friends and enemies.

                Counter-Strike took the gaming industry by surprise when the unlikely MOD became the most played online PC action game in the world almost immediately after its release in August 1999. For the past 12 years, it has continued to be one of the most-played games in the world, headlining competitive gaming tournaments and selling over 25 million units worldwide across the franchise. CS: GO expands on CS' award-winning gameplay and delivers it to gamers on the PC as well as the next gen consoles and the Mac.

            <h4>What does a hero truly need?</h4>
            <p>
                That depends upon the hero! Dota is a competitive game of action and strategy, played both professionally and casually by millions of passionate fans worldwide. Players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes, forming two teams of five players. Radiant heroes then battle their Dire counterparts to control a gorgeous fantasy landscape, waging campaigns of cunning, stealth, and outright warfare.

                Irresistably colorful on the surface, Dota is a game of infinite depth and complexity. Every hero has an array of skills and abilities that combine with the skills of their allies in unexpected ways, to ensure that no game is ever remotely alike. This is one of the reasons that the Dota phenomenon has continued to grow. Originating as a fan-made Warcraft 3 modification, Dota was an instant underground hit. After coming to Valve, the original community developers have bridged the gap to a more inclusive audience, so that the rest of the world can experience the same core gameplay, but with the level of polish that only Valve can promise.
