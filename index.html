            <h2>Half-Life 2</h2>
            <h4>"The Best Game Ever Made" - PC Gamer</h4>
            <p>
                Pick up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, and find yourself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. You must rescue the world from the wrong you unleashed back at Black Mesa.
            </p>
            <p>
                The original Half-Life sent a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title won more than 50 Game of the Year awards, was named "Best Game Ever" by PC Gamer, and launched a franchise which has since sold over 11 million units worldwide. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original Half-Life and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the playerâ€™s presence affects everything around him or her, from the physical environment to the behaviors and even the emotions of both friends and enemies.

            <h4>An innovative new game type is born.</h4>
            <p>
                Portal has been called one of the most innovative games of the decade. A hybrid of FPS style and a new genre of spatial brain teasers, Portal offers hours of totally unique gameplay. Set in the mysterious Aperture Science Laboratories, players must solve physical puzzles and challenges by opening portals, maneuvering objects, and moving themselves through space in ways that used to be impossible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Playing Portal today will teach you how to love a "companion cube", whether a computer named GLaDOS really wants you dead, and why your friends keep telling you
"The cake is a lie".

        <p>
            Other games pay lip-service to class variety, while actually offering only thin variations on basic combat. TF2, on the other hand, delivers, offering widely divergent gameplay styles and appealing to a broad range of tactical abilities and skills. And on top of the nine classes themselves, TF2's unique game modes, signature art style, and persistent player statistics combine to create a wildly fun and addictive experience.

            <h2>Left 4 Dead</h2>
            <h4>The zombie horror game that redefined cooperative action gameplay.</h4>
            <p>
                This co-op action horror game for the PC and Xbox 360 casts players in an epic struggle for human survival against swarming zombie hordes and terrifying mutant monsters. Set in the immediate aftermath of the zombie apocalypse, L4D's survival co-op mode lets you blast a path through the infected in four unique campaigns. Each campaign, or "movie", is comprised of five large maps, and can be played by one to four human players, with an emphasis on team-based strategy and objectives. Making your way through an abandoned metropolis, rural ghost towns, and pitch-black forests, you and your friends join forces to escape a devastated Ground Zero crawling with infected enemies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Innovative technology dubbed "the AI Director" is used to generate a unique gameplay experience every time you play. The Director tailors the frequency and ferocity of the zombie attacks to your performance, putting you in the middle of a fast-paced, but not overwhelming, Hollywood horror movie.
            </p>
            <p>
                Versus Mode also lets you compete 4-on-4 with friends, playing either as a

            <p>
                Building on the innovations of its predecessor, Left 4 Dead 2 brings co-op gameplay to new heights through new game modes and features like the A.I. Director 2.0. This improved director creates a customized experience, matched to your style of play, by controlling pathways through the world, enemy populations, music & sound, visual effects and even the weather.

            <p>
                Portal 2 draws from the award-winning formula of innovative gameplay, story, and music that earned the original Portal over 70 industry accolades and created a cult following.
            </p>
            <p>

Players will explore never-before-seen areas of the Aperture Science Labs and be reunited with GLaDOS, the occasionally murderous computer companion who guided them through the original game.
            </p>
            <p>
                The gameâ€™s two-player cooperative mode features its own entirely separate campaign with a unique story, test chambers, and two new player characters.

            <h2>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</h2>
            <h4>The next generation of the world's #1 online action game.</h4>
            <p>
                Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) expands upon the team-based action gameplay that it pioneered when the original CS was launched 12 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                CS: GO features new maps, characters, and weapons and delivers updated versions of the classic CS content (de_dust, etc.). In addition, CS: GO introduces new gameplay modes, matchmaking, leader boards, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Counter-Strike took the gaming industry by surprise when the unlikely MOD became the most played online PC action game in the world almost immediately after its release in August 1999. For the past 12 years, it has continued to be one of the most-played games in the world, headlining competitive gaming tournaments and selling over 25 million units worldwide across the franchise. CS: GO expands on CS' award-winning gameplay and delivers it to gamers on the PC as well as the next gen consoles and the Mac.

            <h2>Dota 2</h2>
            <h4>What does a hero truly need?</h4>
            <p>
                That depends upon the hero! Dota is a competitive game of action and strategy, played both professionally and casually by millions of passionate fans worldwide. Players pick from a pool of over a hundred heroes, forming two teams of five players. Radiant heroes then battle their Dire counterparts to control a gorgeous fantasy landscape, waging campaigns of cunning, stealth, and outright warfare.
            </p>
            <p>
                Irresistably colorful on the surface, Dota is a game of infinite depth and complexity. Every hero has an array of skills and abilities that combine with the skills of their allies in unexpected ways, to ensure that no game is ever remotely alike. This is one of the reasons that the Dota phenomenon has continued to grow. Originating as a fan-made Warcraft 3 modification, Dota was an instant underground hit. After coming to Valve, the original community developers have bridged the gap to a more inclusive audience, so that the rest of the world can experience the same core gameplay, but with the level of polish that only Valve can promise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Get a taste of the game that has enthralled millions.
